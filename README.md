HI Developers 👋

✨ I'm Full Stack Web Developer ✨

The crossover between design and programming has always been of interest to me, I've been lucky enough to work alongside some talented teams on a number of high profile websites. I have a wide range of skills that include back-end development using open source technologies (NodeJs, Python)front-end development (ReactJs, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Responsive, UX),database(Mysql). I am looking for a company willing to offer me a placement among their developers. In return, I would offer my full commitment, and be a pleasant and friendly addition to your team.
